# Optimal Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations at KNUST Campus

## Overview

This repository contains the project files and documentation related to the optimal placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations on the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) campus. The goal of this project is to identify suitable locations for EV charging stations that will promote sustainable transportation on campus.

## Background

As electric vehicles become increasingly popular outside the country, it is not too far-fetched that Ghana may follow suite and it is therefore essential to provide convenient and accessible charging infrastructure. The KNUST campus, with its large and diverse community, can benefit from strategically placed EV charging stations to encourage eco-friendly transportation options, even though there are not any EVs at the moment.

## Data

The analysis for this project uses the following datasets and information sources:

## Methodology

Our methodology involves a simulation of Electric Vehicles trips based Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles trips on the assumption that user behaviour is the same regardless of whether Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles or Electric Vehicles are used.

Next charge demand is estimated,and then optimization techniques are used to determine the optimal placement of EV charging stations. We consider distribution system factors such as power loss and anticipated EV demand.
